  The "off" state of this feature gate introduced a regression, where the Collector's internal logs were missing component attributes. See issue #12870 for more details on this bug.
  
  On the other hand, the "on" state introduced an issue with the Collector's default internal metrics, because the Prometheus exporter does not currently support instrumentation scope attributes.

  To solve both of these issues, this change turns on the new scope attributes for logs and traces by default regardless of the feature gate.
  However, the new scope attributes for metrics stay locked behind the feature gate, and will remain off by default until the Prometheus exporter is updated to support scope attributes.

  Please understand that enabling the `telemetry.newPipelineTelemetry` feature gate may break the export of Collector metrics through, depending on your configuration.
  Having a `batch` processor in multiple pipelines is a known trigger for this.
  
  This comes with a breaking change, where internal logs exported through OTLP will now use instrumentation scope attributes to identify the source component instead of log attributes.
  This does not affect the Collector's stderr output. See the changelog for v0.123.0 for a more detailed description of the gate's effects.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
