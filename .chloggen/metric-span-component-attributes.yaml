  All internal telemetry now includes one or more of the following instrumentation scope attributes:
  - `otelcol.component.kind`
  - `otelcol.component.id`
  - `otelcol.pipeline.id`
  - `otelcol.signal`
  - `otelcol.signal.output`
  These attributes are defined in the [Pipeline Component Telemetry RFC](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/rfcs/component-universal-telemetry.md#attributes),
  and identify the component instance from which the telemetry originates.
  These attributes are added automatically without changes to component code by wrapping the
  `MeterProvider`, `TracerProvider`, and `Logger` provided to them.
  Components will be able to opt out of one or more of these attributes, but that API is not yet
  publicly available.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user, api]
